# public-api-requests

This project communicates with a public third party API known as the "Random User Generator" to generate fake data for this employee directory. This project utilizes a programming fundamental known as asynchronous programming to complete multiple things to happen at once, in this case the webpage itself can make a call to the API for data without blocking any other parts of the page or user interaction.
